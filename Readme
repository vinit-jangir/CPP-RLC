# CPP-RLC (C++ Rocket Launch Calculator)

A comprehensive command-line rocket science calculator built in C++ for educational purposes and space enthusiasts.

## Features

- **Escape Velocity Calculator** - Calculate the minimum speed needed to break free from a planet's gravitational pull
- **Orbital Velocity Calculator** - Determine the speed required to maintain a stable orbit
- **Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation** - Calculate Delta-V, mass ratios, and fuel consumption
- **Fuel Requirements Calculator** - Compute fuel needed for desired Delta-V missions
- **Launch Trajectory Simulator** - Real-time simulation of rocket launches with altitude and velocity tracking
- **Real Rocket Database** - Compare specifications of famous rockets (Saturn V, Falcon 9, Starship, Space Shuttle, Soyuz)

## Technologies Used

- C++ Standard Library
- Mathematical computations using `<cmath>`
- Console-based user interface
